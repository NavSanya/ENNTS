# ENNTS - Exploring Neural Network Training Speed
## About The Project
We are tackling the problem: if we have an NN already trained to approximate a function described by the dataset. What is the time needed to further train it on a different problem described by dataset B?
Develop a new method to estimate the time a Neural Network takes to train. Through this method, we can make an informed decision if it is worth training a Neural Network.
